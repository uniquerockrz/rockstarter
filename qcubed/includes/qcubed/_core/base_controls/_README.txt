These are the core QCodo controls. Do not change them. If you want to override them, make your changes in the qcubed/includes/controls directory.

The "Gen" controls are generated by scripts found in the assets/php/_devtools/jquery_ui_gen directory. These scripts scrape the JQuery UI Web site to create a basic interface to accessing the JQuery UI controls. The "Base" controls provide additional enhancements to make the controls more QCodo friendly.
