	 * 
	 * One of the JqButtonGen properties use the same names as standard QCubed properties.
	 * The text property is a boolean in the JqUi object that specifies whether
	 * to show text or just icons (provided icons are defined), and the Label property overrides
	 * the standard HTML of the button. Because of the name conflict, the JQ UI property is called
	 * ->JqText. You can also use ShowText as an alias to this as well so that your code is more readable.
	 * 	Text = standard html text of button
	 *  Label = override of standard HTML text, if you want a button to say something different when JS is on or off
	 *  ShowText = whether or not to hide the text of the button when icons are set
	 *
