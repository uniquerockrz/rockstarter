		<h1 class="instruction_title">Non-Table Bound Attributes</h1>
		Occasionally you may need to create custom database queries which retrieve other columns
		or values which are not in the table itself.  This may be a one-off column in another
		table, a calculated value, etc.<br/><br/>
		
		You can utlize the generated data object to easily retrieve these <b>virtual attributes</b>
		from the object, itself, as long as you code your custom database query correctly.  In short,
		if you prefix any additional or non-table bound columns with a double-underscore ("__"), the
		generated object will read in the column as a virtual attribute.  You can then use the generated
		<b>GetVirtualAttribute</b> method to retrieve the value of the data.<br/><br/>
		
		In our example below, we create a custom SQL query which uses SQL's <b>COUNT</b> function and
		subselects to calculate the number of team member for each project.<br/><br/>

		By utilizing <b>Virtual Attributes</b>, complex queries with calculated values,
		subselects, etc. can be retrieved in a single database query, and all the values can be
		stored in the data object, itself.
