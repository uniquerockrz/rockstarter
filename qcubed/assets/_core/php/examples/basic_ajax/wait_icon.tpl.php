		In this Hello World example, we add a <b>QWaitIcon</b>, sometimes also known as "Spinners",
		which will be displayed during the entire AJAX call.<br/><br/>
		
		To add the <b>QWaitIcon</b>, you can define a <b>DefaultWaitIcon</b> in your form,
		passing in a <b>QWaitIcon</b> object.  At this point forward, every <b>QAjaxAction</b>
		will, by default, use the defined wait icon to be displayed during your AJAX call.
		<br/><br/>
		
		This display can be overridden by either passing in <b>null</b> for the wait icon to your
		ajax action call, or alternatively you can pass in <i>another</i> <b>QWaitIcon</b> object
		defined in your form.<br/><br/>
		
		Be sure to remember to render your wait icon on your page!  (Note: artificial sleep/wait time
		has been added to the <b>btnButton_Click</b> method in order to illustrate the spinner in
		action)
