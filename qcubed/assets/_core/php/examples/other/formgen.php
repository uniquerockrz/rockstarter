		With the understanding of how the <b>Code Generator</b> can generate your data
		objects which is the heart of your <b>Model</b>, and with the examples
		of how you can use the <b>QForm</b> and <b>QControl</b> libraries to build out your
		<b>View</b> and <b>Controller</b>, you should now understand that
		the combination of both provides you a very flexible framework that
		utilizes the MVC architecture.<br/><br/>

		Please note that it is <i>very important</i> that you have a good understanding of
		<b>QForm</b> and <b>QControls</b> before moving forward, otherwise this section will
		be difficult to understand, and even more difficult to utilize.<br/><br/>
		
		The next couple of pages will discuss the three main <b>QForm</b>- and <b>QControl</b>-related
		components that the Code Generator generates code for:
		<ul>
			<li>MetaControl Classes</li>
			<li>Meta DataGrid Classes</li>
			<li>QForm and QPanel Drafts</li>
		</ul>
