		Many developers may want to create their own, custom QControl to perform a very specific interaction.
		Alternatively, developers may wish to utilize exernal JavaScript libraries like Dojo, Yahoo! YUI, etc.
		to create their own set of QControls with a polished "Web 2.0" shine.
		<br/><br/>

		Whatever the case may be, QCubed makes it easy to implement custom controls, complete with javascript
		input and output hooks, within the QControl architecture.
		<br/><br/>

		The core distribution comes with QSampleControl, which can act as a vanilla, sample starting point from
		which a developer can begin implementing his or her custom control.<br/><br/>
