		<h1 class="instruction_title">Emailing via SMTP</h1>

		The <b>QEmailServer</b> class can be used to send email messages via any accessible
		SMTP server.  Obviously, many PHP developers will be familiar with the PHP <b>mail()</b>
		function, which internally makes a shell call to <b>sendmail</b>.  But note that for
		<i>many</i> reasons (including security, maintenance and deployability), <b>QEmailServer</b>
		does <i>not</i> use PHP's <b>mail()</b> nor does it use <b>sendmail</b>.<br/><br/>

		<b>QEmailServer</b> is an abstract class which only has static variables (which
		define the location of the SMTP server and other preferences) and a single static
		<b>Send</b> method.  The <b>Send</b> method takes in a <b>QEmailMessage</b> object.<br/><br/>

		The <b>QEmailMessage</b> object contains the relavent email addresses (e.g. From,
		To, Cc and Bcc), as well as the subject and body.  Note that the body can be in
		either plain text, HTML or both.  QCubed will automatically handle the multipart
		message encoding for you.<br/><br/>
		
		You can easily add attachments to your message - using <b>QEmailAttachment</b> and
		its child classes, for example, <b>QEmailStringAttachment</b>. In the example below, 
		we create a new <b>QEmailStringAttachment</b> object and then call <b>Attach()</b> on
		the <b>QEmailMessage</b> object - that's all it takes.<br/><br/>
		
		Finally, note that for development environments that do not have ready access
		to an SMTP server, the <b>QEmailServer</b> can be set to <b>TestMode</b>,
		where communication between the application and the SMTP server will be written
		to disk instead of an SMTP socket.  This allows developers to develop and test
		email capability without actually sending out any emails.<br/><br/>

		Feel free to View Source the code.  Note that the final <b>Send</b> call is
		commented out, so this page is actually non-functional.  But you can view the
		code to get a sense as to how the <b>QEmailServer</b> and its associated
		<b>QEmailMessage</b> class work.
