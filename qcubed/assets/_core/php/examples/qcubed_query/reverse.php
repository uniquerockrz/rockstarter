		<h1 class="instruction_title">QQ and Reverse Relationships</h1>
		The power of QCubed ORM is the ability not just to code generate the code to handle foreign key
		relationships, but also the ability to have that code handle the "reverse" foreign key relationships. 
		So in the Examples Site data model, we're talking about not just a <b>Project</b> and its <b>ManagerPerson</b>
		property... but we're also talking about a Person and methods like <b>GetProjectAsManagerArray()</b>.<br/><br/>
		
		<b>QCubed Query</b> also has this built-in capability, which works very similar to the way <b>QQ</b> handles Associations.
		And this should make sense -- from <b>Person's</b> point of view, it has a "-to-Many" relationship with <b>Project</b> as a Manager
		(via the reverse relationship), and it has a "-to-Many" relationship with <b>Project</b> as a Team Member (via the
		association table).  Therefore <b>QQ</b> has the ability to perform the full set of <b>QQ</b> functionality
		(including conditions, expansions, ordering, grouping, etc.) on tables related via these reverse relationships
		just as it would on tables related via a direct foreign key or association table.<br/><br/>

		The naming standards for the relationship as well as the differences between <b>Expand</b> vs. <b>ExpandAsArray</b>
		are all the exact same as the case with association tables.
