		<h1 class="instruction_title">QQ and Association Tables (Many-to-Many Relationships)</h1>
		One key feature of <b>QCubed Query</b> is its ability to treat relationships in Association tables just like
		any other foreign key relationship.  <b>QQ</b> has the ability to perform the full set of <b>QQ</b> functionality
		(including conditions, expansions, ordering, grouping, etc.) on tables related via association tables
		just as it would on tables related via a direct foreign key.<br/><br/>

		Naming standards for the many to many relationship are the same as the naming standards for the public methods
		for associating/unassociating in the class, itself.  So just as <b>$objPerson->Get<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ProjectAsTeamMember</span>Array</b> will
		retrieve an array of Project objects that are associated to this Person object as a "Team Member", 
		<b>QQN::Person()->ProjectAsTeamMember</b> will refer to the "team_member_project_assn" association table joined against
		the "person" table.<br/><br/>

		And again, because all the <b>QQ Nodes</b> are linked together, you can go from there to pull the project table, itself, as
		well as any columns from that project table.  In fact, the linkages can go indefinitely.
		<b>QQN::Person()->ProjectAsTeamMember->Project->ManagerPerson->FirstName</b> refers to the "first name of the manager
		of any project that this person is a team member of."<br/><br/>

		More importantly, when performing <b>QCubed Queries</b> across association tables, we can <b>Expand</b> on the many-to-many
		relationship, which would use a special virtual attribute to help describe the individual object, itself, which was involved for the join.
		In this case, if we were to do a query of the person table, expanding on any ProjectAsTeamMember objects, the actual project that is joined is available
		to the Person object as $objPerson->_ProjectAsTeamMember.<br/><br/>

		And finally, on a similar note, you could instead use <b>ExpandAsArray</b> which would do a similar expansion
		on the associated object, but store it as an array.  See below for the differences of each.
