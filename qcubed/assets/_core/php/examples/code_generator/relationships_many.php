		<h1 class="instruction_title">Using Association Tables</h1>
		QCubed also supports handling many-to-many relationships.  Typically, many-to-many relationships are
		mapped in the database using an <b>Association Table</b> (sometimes also called a <b>Mapping</b>
		or a <b>Join Table</b>).  It is basically a two-column table where both
		columns are Foreign Keys to two different tables.<br/><br/>

		QCubed allows you to define a set suffix for all <b>Association Tables</b> (the default is "_assn").
		Whenever the code generator sees any table that ends in "_assn", it will mark it as a special
		table to be used/analyzed as an <b>Association Table</b>, associating two objects together in a many-to-many
		relationship.

		With the <b>Association Table</b> in place, QCubed will generate five methods each for the two classes
		involved in this many-to-many relationship.  In our example, we created a <b>team_member_project_assn</b>
		table to represent a many-to-many relationship between <b>Person</b> and <b>Project</b>.<br/><br/>

		QCubed will generate the following five methods in <b>Person</b> to deal with this many-to-many
		relationship:
		<ul>
		<li>GetProjectAsTeamMemberArray</li>
		<li>CountProjectsAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>AssociateProjectAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>UnassociateProjectAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>UnassociateAllProjectsAsTeamMember</li>
		</ul>

		QCubed will also generate the following five methods in <b>Project</b> to deal with this many-to-many
		relationship:
		<ul>
		<li>GetPersonAsTeamMemberArray</li>
		<li>CountPeopleAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>AssociatePersonAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>UnassociatePersonAsTeamMember</li>
		<li>UnassociateAllPeopleAsTeamMember</li>
		</ul>
		
		Note that the structure of these five methods are very similar for both objects (get, count,
		associate, unassociate, and unassociate all).  In fact, you will also notice that this is 
		the same structure as the reverse one-to-many relationship in our previous example.  This especially
		makes sense considering that for all three examples, the object is dealing with the "-to-many" side
		of the relationship.  Regardless if it is a one-"to-many" or a many-"to-many", the five methods
		dealing with "-to-many" is consistent.<br/><br/>

		Also, similar to our previous example, note that the "AsTeamMember" token in all these methods are
		there because we named the <b>Association Table</b> in the database <b>team_member_project_assn</b>.
		If we simply named it <b>person_project_assn</b>, then
		the methods would be named without the "AsTeamMember" token (e.g. "GetProjectArray", "AssociatePerson",
		etc.)<br/><br/>
