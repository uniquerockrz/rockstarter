		Welcome to your first <b>QForm</b>!  This example shows how you can create a few
		<b>QControl</b> objects (in this case, a <b>QLabel</b> and a <b>QButton</b>) and set their text
		inside.  It also assigns a <b>QClickEvent</b> on the button to a <b>QServerAction</b>.  
		This server action (which is a PHP method) will simply modify the label to say
		"Hello, World!".<br/><br/>

		All <b>QForm</b> objects use an HTML include file -- in thise case, we define the HTML in
		the <b>intro.tpl.php</b> file.  Note that there are <b>RenderBegin()</b> and <b>RenderEnd()</b>
		methods which are required to be called within the template in order to output the
		appropriate &lt;form&gt; tags, and also outputs any additional HTML and JavaScript
		that makes the <b>QForm</b> work. (QCubed will in fact throw an exception
		if either <b>RenderBegin</b> and <b>RenderEnd</b> are not called.)<br/><br/>
		
		Click on the "View Source" link in the upper righthand corner to view the
		<b>intro.php</b> and <b>intro.tpl.php</b> code, which together define this <b>QForm</b>
		you are seeing.
